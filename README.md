# CN-OS-LAB
Repository for Laboratory codes

This Repo contains the Programs for implementing the alogortihms for Operating Systems Laboratory.
I have added the c program files and the outputs recieved on executing the programs on my c compiler.

I have used the C programming language to write the programs.
The outputs recieved are uploaded in the webpage format (html) and hence some part of the repositpory also has html inlcuded.
